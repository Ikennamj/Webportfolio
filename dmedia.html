  <p>Social Media Advocacy</p>
  <p>&nbsp</p>
  <p> My visual argument was created as a campaign against bullying on social media.
		I as an artist like using animated media as a medium becuase it appeals to all audiences
		and is very flexible to work with.

  <p>A Day In The Life</p>
  <p>&nbsp</p>
  <p> My soundscape narrative was a project we had in class to create something with audio.
		I chose to make an audio version of a video log flled with sounds we hear throughout the
		day like classes, road noises, the shower, brushing teeth, and more. There's also background
		music to make it more exciting.
