  <h1>The Evolution Of The Bicycle</h1>
  <blockquote>"Life is like riding a bicycle. To keep your balance you must keep moving." - Albert Einstein</blockquote>
  <p>
    In 1817 Baron von Drais invented a walking machine that would help him get around the royal gardens faster: two same-size in-line wheels,
    the front one steerable, mounted in a frame upon which you straddled. The device was propelled by pushing your feet against the ground,
    thus rolling yourself and the device forward in a sort of gliding walk.
